# Cloud Services

Cloud stuff that makes your life easier while developing fun stuff.

## Storage

- https://firebase.google.com/ Much more than just storage, I guess (but that's what I'm using it for), Firebase lets you outsource a lot of backend stuff to Google and focus on the fun parts.
- https://tipe.io/ Create a GraphQL schema file and Tipe generates your API, content model, and the editor UI. Simple.
